# clang-format-styles

> Current version: __14.0.1__

This repository contains a history of the predefined styles from `clang-format`.

Whenever LLVM releases a new version of `clang-tools`, 
the styles in this repository are updated.

## Generation

The style files are generated by a Nix flake in the 
[source branch](https://github.com/jessestricker/clang-format-styles/tree/source).
It is built automatically by a GitHub workflow.
